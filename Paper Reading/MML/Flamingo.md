# Abstract

Target:Building models that can be rapidly adapted to novel tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research.

Architectural innovations:
1. bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models;
2. handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data;
3. seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs.
